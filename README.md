# Tourist-Planner
## About
A school project which calculates the shortest or an alternate path between two cities.
The structure is made with a graph where each city is a vertix and the routes are edges with weights. There are two different ways to travel: Private and public, the first being faster but more expensive and the second slower but cheaper, or a both option to see which one is better for your sorting filter.
After choosing the means of travel you can choose the shortest or alternate route based on three different weights: Time, cost and distance. The algorithm used to calculate the shortest is Djikstra while the alternate goes all the way around to reach the destination giving you the longest route.
All the information is pulled from a local Microsoft SQL Server in which the user can, through the windows forms UI, add, remove and edit cities and routes.
Finally, in the information tab, you can change the language from english to spanish
